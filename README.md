# waffling60

waffling60 is a multilayout 60% PCB with support for common ANSI and ISO layouts and split space. One version features hot swaps, one is a solder PCB. Hot swap board uses both north, south and 90-degree rotated switches, which might cause some compatibility issues with some keycaps.

## Status:
Prototyping phase.

## Some features:
- QMK
- USB-C
- atmega32u2 in QFN and QFP
- RGB-led close to capslock
- Cherry PCB-stab support
- Split space
- ISO and ANSI
- On solder version: Switch rotation is only with LED facing south.

## Revisions:
- Rev A1: Initial prototype based on Steezy60 Alps-version.
- Rev A2: Rotate Fn-switch (split RShift) on solder version. Rotate LShift stabilizer on both versions. To rotate left shift stabilizer on hot-swap pcb, adjacent sockets is also rotated.
